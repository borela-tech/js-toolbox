    // may arise from a bug in IE 8 and earlier, in which the catch clause
    // parameter can leak into outer scopes. This rule will warn whenever it
    // encounters a catch clause parameter that has the same name as a variable

    // creating a label that shares a name with a variable that is in scope.

    // This rule aims to eliminate variable declarations that initialize to
    // undefined.
