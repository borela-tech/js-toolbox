## Style guides

### Commit messages

* Use the present tense: “*Add feature.*” instead of “*Added feature.*”.
* Use the imperative mood: “*Move file to...*” instead of “*Moves file to...*”.
* Lines must not exceed 72 characters.
* Use asterisks for bullet points.
* Use a hanging indent for bullet points that goes through multiple lines.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally.

#### Example of a commit message:

    Summary (72 chars or less)

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
    characters. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
    subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank
    line separating the summary from the body is critical unless you omit
    the body entirely.

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

    * An asterisk followed by a single space is used for bullet points
      with blank lines in between them.

    * Use a hanging indent for bullet points that goes through multiple
      lines.

### License headers

This project uses the [Apache 2.0 license][license] and one of its requirements
is a header which makes it easier for other people to know which license was
used without having to look into the root of the project.

The original header has the author and an email, but in this case it won’t be
necessary as one of the project’s requirements is that you use your real name
and email in the commits so that we can track the author easily.

Not all files need a license header, configuration files are a  good example of
that, so, if a file required careful design on your part, use one of these:
